#The syntax looks like this:

#class DerivedClass < Base
#  def some_method
#    super(optional args)
#      # Some stuff
#    end
#  end
#end
#When you call super from inside a method, that tells Ruby to look in the superclass of the current class and find a method with the same name as the one from which super is called. If it finds it, Ruby will use the superclassâ€™ version of the method.
